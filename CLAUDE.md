# CLAUDE.md — operating manual for VerticalBusinessDesigner (VBD)

This file is loaded into context every session. It is the rules of the road. Read it, follow it,
and update it when a rule changes. Product name: **VerticalBusinessDesigner**; the repo dir is
`VerticalBusinessDesiger` (historical misspelling — don't rename it).

## What this is
An LLM-guided **"Business Compiler"**: describe a vertical business in structured text → an LLM
derives a formal model → deterministic validators check it → it renders as an interactive,
reviewable **Capability Map**. Text is the source of truth; the graphic is a projection.

## Golden invariants (do not violate)
1. **Text is the source of truth; the UI/graph is a projection of the IR.** Never store truth in
   the canvas. Node positions are computed (elk), never persisted.
2. **Every IR node/edge is `authored` or `derived`.** Only `authored` elements round-trip to text
   and are editable; `derived` elements are read-only projections.
3. **Secrets never reach the browser.** The Anthropic key (`VBD_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, in the
   gitignored root `.env`) lives only in `apps/service`. The web app POSTs to the service; it
   never calls the model or holds the key.
4. **Pure packages are isomorphic + dependency-free.** `@vbd/ir|compiler|validation|narrative|skills|eval`
   run in Node tests AND the browser. No `node:*` builtins in them (use the isomorphic `sha256`
   from `@vbd/ir`, not `node:crypto`). `@vbd/store` and `apps/service` are the server-only exception.
5. **The model proposes; validators + the human decide.** LLM output is coerced, validated, and
   human-editable. Generated capabilities must carry grounded provenance (`meta.derivedFrom`,
   enforced by validator V8).

## Architecture (where things live)
```
packages/
  ir/          IR types (the spine) + isomorphic sha256/canonical/slug/edgeId
  schema/      JSON Schemas (capability.schema.json)
  compiler/    authored artifacts → IR (+ computeBuildHash)
  validation/  deterministic validators over the CapabilityDoc/IR (V1–V2, V8; V3–V7 WIP)
  narrative/   Business Narrative parser (heading-anchored) + completeness validators (NV1–NV4)
  store/       .vbd/ derived cache with buildHash-on-load (server-only; ADR-002)
  eval/        seeded-defect + generation-coverage scoring (gold-free)
  skills/      LLM skill runtime: CapabilityGenerator, MockProvider, NarrativeCoach prompt
apps/
  web/         React + Vite SPA (narrative interview/markdown, capability map, forms, projects)
  service/     Node API holding the key: /api/generate, /api/coach, /api/models, /api/usage
workspaces/    user data (solar-example fixture)
docs/          governed plans/specs/reviews/ADRs — see docs/CONVENTIONS.md
```
The **IR is the contract**: every view and validator reads it. Validators are pure functions.

## Tech & conventions
- **TypeScript end-to-end** (ADR-001). Node ≥ 20 runs `.ts` natively (type-stripping) — packages
  have **no build step**. `@types/node`/`typescript` are intentionally not installed, so the editor
  shows "cannot find module 'node:*'" squiggles — harmless; runtime is fine.
- **Tests:** `node:test` + `node:assert/strict`. Run `npm test` (currently **134** passing). Every
  new pure function gets a test in `packages/*/test/*.test.ts`.
- **Web:** Vite. `npm run build --workspace @vbd/web` must pass. Verify UI changes **in the browser**
  (the preview tools), not just tests — the invariants are visual.
- **Storage:** git for authored docs (ADR-002); the web app persists projects to **localStorage**
  (`vbd.projects`, ADR-005 — interim until a git-backed workspace API).

## Running it
```
npm install                          # links workspaces only (offline; no registry fetch for pkgs)
npm run dev --workspace @vbd/web      # http://localhost:5188
npm run dev --workspace @vbd/service  # http://localhost:8787 (loads root .env)
npm test                              # all package tests
```
Real LLM generation/interview needs `VBD_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...` in the gitignored root `.env`.

## LLM rules
- The project is TypeScript → use the **official `@anthropic-ai/sdk`**, never raw HTTP. SDK usage
  lives only in `apps/service`.
- **Do not guess the Anthropic API.** Consult the `claude-api` skill for model ids, effort/thinking,
  and structured outputs before writing LLM code.
- Default model **`claude-sonnet-5`**, effort **`medium`** ("sonnet medium"). `output_config.effort`
  is GA on Sonnet 5 / Opus 4.x but **errors on Haiku 4.5** → effort is coupled per-model.
- Use **structured outputs** (`output_config.format`) to lock JSON shapes; keep a one-shot repair
  retry; wrap user/business text as DATA (prompt-injection safety).

## Docs & process discipline
- All plans/specs/reviews/ADRs go under `docs/` per **`docs/CONVENTIONS.md`** (ID prefixes, frontmatter,
  **status lifecycle**). Update `docs/INDEX.md` when adding/changing a doc.
- Specs and plans get **independent, multi-lens review to closure** before `Approved`; log finding
  disposition in the doc. ADRs record decisions.

## Git
- Commit when a coherent unit is green. **Before committing: `npm test` + web build.** Commit
  often; small, clear messages.
- End every commit message with:
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- `.env`, `node_modules/`, `.vbd/`, `dist/` are gitignored — never commit them.

## Status (keep current)
- **Building the FULL methodology stack** (user: "the whole enchilada"): policies ✅ → roles ✅ →
  workflows ✅ → agents ✅ → application/implementation blueprints ✅ → execution codegen MCP/React ✅ (adapters hand-owned per ADR-002). FULL STACK BUILT.
- **SPEC-009 orchestration (workflow-vs-agent router) BUILT** — each process carries an authored
  `WorkflowInput.mode` (`workflow`|`agent`). `@vbd/skills` orchestration skill (mock heuristic +
  `generateOrchestration` LLM + `/api/orchestration`, prompt `orchestration.md`) proposes; the app's
  **Workflows stage is the review/override screen** (per-process "Run as" toggle + Auto-classify).
  Mode-DRIVES codegen: workflow-mode → n8n `process_*`; agent-mode → folded into the covering agent's
  `behaviours/<id>.md` ("Processes you own"). Exporter emits `ORCHESTRATION.md`. Solar: 4 workflow, 1 agent.
- **Excel + External-services (delegation) + 3-way orchestration BUILT** — Excel = an integration
  `transport` (xlsx|gsheet → n8n Sheets/Excel nodes) + a comms `spreadsheet` channel (rendered .xlsx,
  like pdf). External services (`@vbd/codegen` services.ts): delegate to EXISTING workflows/agents —
  `sync` (call & record via a command) or `async` (fire + a CALLBACK webhook = a trigger → command / wake
  agent); agents get them as `external` tools; `--external-services`/`/api/external-services`;
  EXTERNAL-SERVICES.md. `ProcessMode` is now `workflow|agent|external` — the Workflows review screen's
  "Run as" toggle is 3-way (External → pick a bound service); external-mode → a thin delegate connector,
  not the internal pipeline. **Per-step delegation** (`WorkflowInput.stepBindings`: step cmd id → service
  id): a workflow-mode process runs internally but any single step can be delegated to a service (the
  n8n pipeline emits a delegate node for that step; UI "Delegate individual steps" panel + 🌐 step marker).
  Routing is composable — process-level AND step-level. Solar: Excel lead import + offer-register export;
  sync Lead Qualifier + async Offer Reviewer. 252 tests.
- **sidebar-16 skin BUILT (both apps)** — generated app: `shadcnAdapter` shell upgraded to shadcn's
  "sidebar-16" inset dashboard (team header + model-derived grouped nav + AppHeader breadcrumb/search +
  inset content card), reproduced dependency-light (React+Tailwind, no shadcn `sidebar` component). VBD
  designer: **full shell swap** — topbar+stage-rail → sidebar (team header + project switcher + labeled
  StageRail nav + footer) + inset content card with breadcrumb topbar + collapse toggle (kept in VBD's own
  CSS, dark palette). Verified in-browser; 255 tests.
- **Enrichment system BUILT (review + web research + auto)** — enrichment surfaced in-app as a human-gated
  accept/decline/adjust diff (`EnrichPanel` + `enrichReview.ts` flatten/rebuild) on the Entities stage:
  "✨ Enrich" proposes missing attributes/child-entities (each individually kept/dropped, ◇ grounded / 🔎
  web + source link), Apply merges only accepted → domain (persisted). **Grounded source** = offline
  `mockEnrichDomain`; **web-research source** = Anthropic `web_search_20260209` (`/api/enrich-web`, prompt
  `enrich-web.md`, SDK-only-in-service; `extractJsonObject`+`coerceEnrichment` SDK-free) returns cited
  additions. **⚡ Auto** = accept-all one-click. Verified in-browser (decline honored; auto 12→16 entities).
  **Rolled out to Capabilities, Roles, Agents** (generic `layerEnrich.ts` flatten/apply + light offline
  grounded + `/api/enrich-layer` web research + `enrich-layer.md`; `EnrichPanel` buckets by `group`). Verified
  in-browser (entities 12→16; roles 7→10, one declined excluded). Remaining stages (behaviour/automations/
  workflows/areas) are cross-ref-heavy → still generate+AI-review. 257 tests.
- **Ingest raw text/transcript BUILT** — the Narrative stage has a "From text/transcript" tab: paste a
  transcript/notes/brief or upload a .txt/.md; `@vbd/skills structureNarrative` (prompt `structure.md` +
  `/api/structure`) projects it into the heading-anchored Business Narrative → the existing derive pipeline.
  (Fixed NarrativeInput to use the config `SERVICE_URL` — was hardcoded localhost.) 256 tests.
- **Generated-app config/env + Vercel auto-deploy scaffold BUILT** — root `.env.example` rewritten to the
  vars the code ACTUALLY reads (mode-aware `DATABASE_URL`/`DB_FILE`, `N8N_BASE_URL`, `N8N_WEBHOOK_TOKEN`,
  `PORT`, `VITE_API_URL`, agent `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; was stale PG*). Remote-ready: spine pg driver honors TLS
  (`PGSSL=require` verified; `no-verify` = documented dev-only), events.ts sends `N8N_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` bearer for
  secured remote n8n. `ui/.env.example` (`VITE_API_URL`) + `ui/vercel.json` (Vite+SPA fallback) +
  `.github/workflows/deploy-vercel.yml` (deploys ui/ on push, self-skips until `VERCEL_TOKEN`/`ORG`/`PROJECT`
  secrets set). DEPLOY.md: Git-integration (no token) vs CI (token=GH secret); n8n/Odoo/Postgres hosted apart.
  Open (rock-solid gaps): spine has NO API auth + RLS is `USING(true)`; input validation; observability. 262 tests.
- **SQLite store engine + dialect-aware migrations BUILT** — SQLite = an embedded, file-based store → a
  single-container generated app (no db service). `SQLITE` engine + `sqliteAdapter` (SQLite affinities,
  `PRAGMA foreign_keys`, `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, no RLS); `spineAdapter(dialect)` emits a
  `better-sqlite3` db.ts (same async interface as pg; booleans→0/1, objects→JSON; `DB_FILE`); `migrate(old,
  new, dialect)` is now postgres|sqlite (SQLite type-change note = "rebuild the table"). Exporter `--sqlite`
  (or `binding.defaults.store=sqlite`) → `sqlite/schema.sql` + `sqlite/migrations/` + a single-container
  docker-compose (node:20-slim spine + a data volume, NO postgres service) + dialect-aware Makefile. Verified
  both modes export; sqlite spine db.ts esbuild-parses; --sqlite --since = SQLite migration. 262 tests.
- **Postgres model-diff migration generator BUILT** — incremental update story (grow a LIVE db, don't drop
  it). `@vbd/codegen/migrate.ts` `migratePostgres(oldDomain,newDomain)`: additive-by-default (new attr → ADD
  COLUMN, new entity → CREATE TABLE, new ref → ADD COLUMN…REFERENCES = live SQL); drops/type-changes = BREAKING
  → emitted COMMENTED with the reason (human decides on data). Mirrors postgresAdapter naming/types. Exporter
  `--since <deployed model.json>` → `postgres/migrations/<version>.sql` + logs additive/breaking counts;
  generated CLAUDE.md says "update a live app via the migration, not schema.sql." n8n already upserts by stable
  id; still no migration for Odoo/other stateful engines. Verified end-to-end. 260 tests.
- **Complete model.json store BUILT** — the whole business is ONE versionable document (all layers). The
  web `Project` now holds every execution-layer decision (services/triggers/comms/integrations/binding/theme/
  i18n), previously mock-only/export-flag splices. `apps/web/src/model.ts` `assembleModel` materializes the
  COMPLETE model (absent layers filled from mock defaults → explicit + self-contained); `parseModel` loads it.
  App: **⬇ Export model / ⬆ Import model** (sidebar footer) round-trip the whole model.json (recall + iterate
  before generating; commit it to git = the chosen git-backed substrate). Exporter now treats model.json as
  the single source of truth (reads authored services/triggers/comms/integrations/binding/theme/i18n from it,
  emits the complete model.json — same shape as the app). Verified in-browser (16 layers; edited service
  survives round-trip). Open: in-app EDIT UI for comms/integrations/binding/theme (edit via model.json for
  now); a server-authoritative auto-git workspace API (still localStorage + manual export/import). 256 tests.
- **Generated-app light/dark + i18n (LLM auto-translation) BUILT** — `ThemeToggle` (.dark class + persisted,
  no-flash init in index.html). i18n: every visible string keyed, rendered via a dependency-free runtime
  (`src/i18n.tsx` `t(key,fallback)`, locale persisted); **base locale = the model's source language** (the
  description's language), base bundle = `appMessages` source strings; LLM `translateMessages` (+ prompt
  `translate.md` + `/api/translate`) translates into target locales; header language switcher when >1 locale;
  exporter `--lang`/`--translations` bake them; `projectTargets` threads `i18n`. Verified via esbuild + a
  German bake. 256 tests.
- **Generated-app in-app HELP system BUILT** — `helpModel` projects the model into end-user docs (screen
  "what" = capability purpose/area intent; action "does" = command→emitted events; processes = workflows;
  roles; automations = policies; field hints from types). `shadcnAdapter` emits `src/help.ts` + a `/help`
  page + a dependency-light "ⓘ Help" drawer per screen (route+nav wired). Regenerated with the app → never
  stale. Solar: 12 entities/5 processes/7 roles/9 automations. 254 tests.
- **Triggers layer + agent HTTP mode BUILT** — `@vbd/codegen` triggers.ts: external signals in
  (webhook|schedule → command|workflow|agent|notify), grounded in the model's external/time events, →
  importable n8n `trigger_*` workflows + `TRIGGERS.md`. The generated agents runtime gained an HTTP mode
  (`pnpm serve` → `POST /run {agent,task}`) so a webhook can WAKE an agent; a webhook→agent trigger POSTs it.
- **SPEC-005 (policies/reactions) BUILT + Approved** — `policy` node + when/then edges,
  `validatePolicies` (PL1–PL7 incl. joined-graph cycle), `PolicyModeler` (precision-biased, single
  call) + `/api/policies`, eval with reactionRecall + **spuriousRate** (anti over-wiring), codegen
  **Workflows** stubs, in-context "Automations" UI. Verified: 7 cross-entity hand-offs on solar.
- **Deployed on Vercel** (SPA + serverless functions, key server-side): https://vertical-business-designer-web.vercel.app
- **Full modeling arc built + partner-validated (SPEC-001…004 Approved).** narrative → capabilities →
  business areas → entities (typed attributes) → commands/events. `@vbd/codegen` projects it to TS
  types + OpenAPI (real command operations, not just CRUD) + event catalog + area-module map; visible
  in-app via the **"View code"** panel.
- **SPEC-005 (policies/reactions) reviewed to closure (REV-022…026) but BUILD DEFERRED.** No strategic
  Blocker; owner chose **consolidate & ship to the design partner first** (product meta-note: 5 layers,
  one partner → get a real demand signal before layer six). Reviewed design is on the shelf (§13).
- **Consolidation done:** cleared the implementation debt the review exposed — reconcile-not-clear for
  the domain (capability edits no longer wipe authored entities/behaviour; delete reconciles) and the
  half-built collapsible-entity disclosure; added the in-app Code preview; fixed a React border warning.
  **Next: ship to partner for a demand signal; then un-shelf SPEC-005 or iterate on their feedback.**

- **M0, M1 complete.** **M2 engineering-complete** — only the human gate is open (a design partner
  to confirm A1 capability correctness). Provenance + V8 done.
- **SPEC-002 (domain layer, aggregates-first) engineering-complete** — DM1 mock, DM2
  `DomainGenerator` (+ `/api/domain`), DM validators in the UI, editable entity forms, DM eval. Exit
  gate GREEN on solar. **A4 (second-domain) now MET** via SPEC-003 §14. Open: A1/A6 design-partner.
- **SPEC-003 (business areas / subdomains) engineering-complete** — the capabilities→areas layer
  (the methodology's `bounded_contexts` rung, surfaced as "Business Areas", honestly a subdomain
  partition). 5-lens reviewed to closure (REV-012..016). Shipped: BC-M0 IR compose (`bctx:` nodes +
  `groups` edges), BC-M1 mock partitioner (affinity+size-cap, no single-blob), BC-M2 `validateContexts`
  (BC1–BC9; BC2 partition guarantee), BC-M3 `ContextGrouper` + `/api/contexts`, BC-M4 backdrop UI
  (colour+legend over the SINGLE map, form-select reassignment, Area-detail, reconcile-not-clear),
  BC eval with an ARI partition-agreement gate. Exit gate (§14): structural GREEN + **A7 second-domain
  PASSED** (dental, no code change); A5 ARI a qualified pass (LLM over-segments vs a coarse single
  reference); **HOLD** on `Approved` pending A6 partner value check.
- **Design partner validated capabilities + entities + areas** → **SPEC-002 & SPEC-003 `Approved`** (v1.0.0).
- **RES-001 codegen probe done** — `@vbd/codegen` (deterministic model→code projection: TS types +
  OpenAPI + area-module map + gap report). **Thesis holds for scaffolding** (solar → 8 TS interfaces,
  16 OpenAPI paths, 3 area modules, no LLM). Two gaps named the next work, both now CLOSED: typed
  attributes + commands/events. `@vbd/codegen` is the yardstick for future layers.
- **Typed entity attributes** — `AttributeSpec {name, type}` (text/number/boolean/date/money/reference);
  codegen emits real TS/OpenAPI types; LLM + human editor both set types. The codegen "untyped" gap is
  closed.
- **SPEC-004 (commands & events) reviewed to closure (REV-017..021), then BUILT** after RES-001
  justified it. IR: command/event nodes + issues/changes/emits/on edges. `validateEvents` (CE1–CE8 +
  emit-boundary). `EventModeler` = events-first, command-is-a-request (emits 0..n), **per-aggregate
  fan-out**, trigger discriminator (command/time/external), `/api/events`. In-context "What happens"
  UI. CE eval with a **commandRecall** quality metric. Exit gate GREEN (§14): commandRecall **1.0**,
  dental second-domain clean, 0 findings. Status `Revised`, **A6 (partner review of behaviour) the
  one open item.**
- Full arc works end-to-end: narrative interview (or markdown) → capabilities (mock / real Sonnet 5)
  → elk map with **Business-Areas backdrop** → editable capability/entity/area forms → validators
  (V1–V8, DM, BC) → multi-project (server + localStorage) → spend estimate.
