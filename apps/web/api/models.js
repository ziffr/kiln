Edit them freely in any markdown editor \u2014 they are just text. This is where prompt\noptimization happens: sharpen these to raise output quality across the whole stack.\n\n## How it flows\n\n```\nprompts/<layer>.md   \u2500\u2500  npm run prompts:build  \u2500\u2500\u25B6  src/prompts.generated.ts  \u2500\u2500\u25B6  the skills import it\n   (you edit this)          (embeds md \u2192 TS)            (generated; do not edit)      (isomorphic, no fs)\n```\n\nThe embed step keeps the `@vbd/skills` package isomorphic (runs in Node **and** the browser, golden\ninvariant #4 \u2014 no `node:fs` at runtime) and build-step-free. Same "text is truth; the projection is\nderived" stance as the product itself.\n\n## Editing a prompt\n\n1. Edit `prompts/<layer>.md` (leave the `---` frontmatter; only the body below it is the prompt).\n2. Run `npm run prompts:build`.\n3. `npm test` \u2014 generation tests should still pass (unless you intended a behavioural change).\n4. Commit the `.md` **and** the regenerated `src/prompts.generated.ts`.\n\n## Each file\'s frontmatter\n\n- `id` \u2014 the prompt key (= filename).\n- `title` \u2014 human label.\n- `const` \u2014 the exported constant it backs (e.g. `DOMAIN_SYSTEM_PROMPT`), so you can trace it in code.\n\n## Layers covered\n\n| file | layer | endpoint |\n|---|---|---|\n| `capability.md` | Capability Map | `/api/generate` |\n| `domain.md` | Domain model (entities) | `/api/domain` |\n| `contexts.md` / `contexts-critique.md` | Business Areas | `/api/contexts` |\n| `events.md` | Behaviour (commands & events) | `/api/events` |\n| `policies.md` | Automations (reactions) | `/api/policies` |\n| `roles.md` | Roles | `/api/roles` |\n| `workflows.md` | Workflows | `/api/workflows` |\n| `agents.md` | Agents | `/api/agents` |\n| `app-logic.md` | App logic (handler bodies) | `/api/app-logic` |\n| `components.md` | App components (views) | `/api/app-components` |\n\n## Not yet externalized\n\nPrompts assembled dynamically in code (parameterized by a lens or built from parts) remain in their\n`.ts` for now: `CODE_REVIEW_SYSTEM_PROMPT` (per-lens), and the NarrativeCoach / semantic-critic prompts.\nThey can be templated into markdown later with a placeholder convention if desired.',

- UNDER-SEGMENTATION: one area doing too much that should be split.
- MISPLACED capability: a capability that clearly belongs in a different area (shares its data/flow).
- INCOHERENT area: capabilities grouped together with no real relationship.
- A missing or unclear area purpose.

For each issue return a "concern" (likely wrong) or "suggestion" (could be better), a short message, a concrete "suggestion" (what to change), and the "area" name and/or "capability" id it is about.

- "references": the ids of the OTHER entities in THIS model that this entity relates to. CONNECT THE MODEL \u2014 most entities reference at least one other. In a value chain an entity references the upstream entity it derives from AND the parties it belongs to (e.g. offer references customer; design references offer; purchase_order references design; work_order references design; invoice references customer and installation). Reference ACROSS capabilities, not only within one. Use the exact entity ids you assign here; never reference an entity that isn't in the model.

  identifiers, money/tax/total fields, dates, addresses, contact fields, status. Give each a business
  "type": text, number, boolean, date, money, or reference.
- Propose CHILD entities for one-to-many relationships (e.g. an Invoice has line items; an Order has
  order lines). A child entity must "references" its parent entity id, and carries its own attributes
  (e.g. description, quantity, unit_price, line_total).
- Match the DEPTH requested: "conservative" = only the few most essential fields, no children;
  "standard" = the normal working field set + obvious children; "exhaustive" = comprehensive, incl.
  audit fields and all sensible children.

Rules:
- Do NOT repeat attributes the entity already has (they are listed).
- Do NOT invent fields that don't belong to a real object of this kind; prefer standard, well-known
  fields over speculative ones. Quality over quantity \u2014 a human reviews and trims your proposal.
- Every child entity's "owner" should be the same capability as its parent (set via the parent it
  references). Every child "references" must include the parent entity's id.

- Prefer CROSS-entity hand-offs \u2014 the interesting reactions connect different entities (e.g. "Invoice Paid" \u2192 "Schedule Installation"). A reaction within the same entity is usually already the command's own effect, so avoid it.
- Be CONSERVATIVE: only wire a reaction when the business flow clearly demands it. Fewer, correct reactions beat many speculative ones. Do NOT create a policy for every event.
- "on" MUST be one of the given event ids; "then" MUST be one of the given command ids.
